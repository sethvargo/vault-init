# vault-init

The `vault-init` service automates the process of [initializing](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/commands/operator/init.html) and [unsealing](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/concepts/seal.html#unsealing) HashiCorp Vault instances running on [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com).

After `vault-init` initializes a Vault server it stores master keys and root tokens, encrypted using [Google Cloud KMS](https://cloud.google.com/kms), to a user defined [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage) bucket.

## Usage

The `vault-init` service is designed to be run alongside a Vault server and
communicate over local host.

You can download the code and compile the binary with Go. Alternatively, a
Docker container is available via the Docker Hub:

```text
$ docker pull sethvargo/vault-init
```

To use this as part of a Kubernetes Vault Deployment:

```yaml
containers:
- name: vault-init
  image: registry.hub.docker.com/sethvargo/vault-init:1.0.0
  imagePullPolicy: Always
  env:
  - name: GCS_BUCKET_NAME
    value: my-gcs-bucket
  - name: KMS_KEY_ID
    value: projects/my-project/locations/my-location/cryptoKeys/my-key
```

## Configuration

The vault-init service supports the following environment variables for configuration:

- `CHECK_INTERVAL` - The time duration between Vault health checks. ("10s")

- `GCS_BUCKET_NAME` - The Google Cloud Storage Bucket where the vault master key and root token is stored.

- `KMS_KEY_ID` - The Google Cloud KMS key ID used to encrypt and decrypt the vault master key and root token.

- `VAULT_SECRET_SHARES` - The number of human shares to create (5).

- `VAULT_SECRET_THRESHOLD` - The number of human shares required to unseal (3).

- `VAULT_AUTO_UNSEAL` - Use Vault 1.0 native auto-unsealing directly. You must
  set the seal configuration in Vault's configuration.

- `VAULT_STORED_SHARES` - Number of shares to store on KMS. Only applies to
  Vault 1.0 native auto-unseal. (1)

- `VAULT_RECOVERY_SHARES` - Number of recovery shares to generate. Only applies
  to Vault 1.0 native auto-unseal. (1)

- `VAULT_RECOVERY_THRESHOLD` - Number of recovery shares needed to unseal. Only
  applies to Vault 1.0 native auto-unseal. (1)

### Example Values

```
CHECK_INTERVAL="30s"
GCS_BUCKET_NAME="vault-storage"
KMS_KEY_ID="projects/my-project/locations/global/keyRings/my-keyring/cryptoKeys/key"
```

### IAM &amp; Permissions

The `vault-init` service uses the official Google Cloud Golang SDK. This means
it supports the common ways of [providing credentials to GCP][cloud-creds].

To use this service, the service account must have the following minimum
scope(s):

```text
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloudkms
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.read_write
```

Additionally, the service account must have the following minimum role(s):

```text
roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter
roles/storage.objectAdmin OR roles/storage.legacyBucketWriter
```

For more information on service accounts, please see the
[Google Cloud Service Accounts documentation][service-accounts].
